Apache Spark is an open source cluster computing system that aims to make data analytics fast â€” 
both fast to run and fast to write.

Spark offers a general execution model that can optimize arbitrary operator graphs, 
and supports in-memory computing, which lets it query data faster than disk-based engines like Hadoop.
